Microsoft live connect api doesnt allow the redirect domain to be localhost.
There is a hack that makes localhost development possible..

the redirect domain in the app console in
https://manage.dev.live.com/Applications/Create must be http://anilkaraka.com
and change your hosts file in your computer such that http://anilkaraka.com redirects
to localhost(127.0.0.1)

since we cannot specify port number in hosts file, we have to start the meteor
application on port 80, which is the default port for chrome when you just type
127.0.0.1 in address bar..
